# Action App

# 1. Background
---

A company would like to develop a feature to ensure that team members "perform an action" (Confirm I've read a new policy, Confirm I've changed the expired password for security, etc.). An idea is suggested: Build an app to require the selected team members/departments/whole company to confirm perform an action (I did it):

- There should be a place for creating the "Action" and select the team members/departments/whole company to perform it.
- There should be a place for member to confirm he/she performed the required Action.
- In the Report Dashboard, show the status of how the "Action" has been performed? Who did or did not? etc. (Need more insights from you)
  
# 2. Goals
---
Allow managers to create, assign and track actions. <br/>
Allow team members to receive and confirm status of actions.

# 3. User Journey
---
**Manager**

- Signs into their profile if existing; otherwise creates one
- Landing page is Dashboard
- Has access to "Create Action"

**Team Member**
